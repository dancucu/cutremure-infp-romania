## CRITICAL FIX - Root Cause Found!

### The Problem
Home Assistant's config flow discovery requires DOMAIN to be a STRING LITERAL in the class definition, not a variable assignment.

❌ What was wrong:
```python
DOMAIN = DOMAIN  # Variable assignment - Home Assistant couldn't find it
```

### The Solution
✅ Fixed:
```python
DOMAIN: str = "cutremure_infp"  # String literal - properly discoverable
```

### Why This Matters
Home Assistant inspects the ConfigFlow class at module load time and needs to see the actual string value to register the handler properly.

### Install
Via HACS: Add custom repository https://github.com/dancucu/cutremure-infp-romania
Then: Restart Home Assistant → Settings → Devices & Services → Create Integration

This should NOW work without "Invalid handler specified" error!
