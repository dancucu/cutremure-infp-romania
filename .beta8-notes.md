## HANDLER REGISTRATION FIX

This release explicitly registers the config flow handler using the `@config_entries.HANDLERS.register(DOMAIN)` decorator pattern.

### Changes:
- Added `@config_entries.HANDLERS.register(DOMAIN)` decorator to `CutremureConfigFlow` class
- Removed the `DOMAIN: str = "cutremure_infp"` class attribute (not needed with explicit registration)
- Changed `self.DOMAIN` back to `DOMAIN` constant in `async_step_user` method

### What This Fixes:
Home Assistant's config flow discovery relies on handlers being properly registered in the HANDLERS registry. By explicitly decorating the class with `@config_entries.HANDLERS.register(DOMAIN)`, we ensure the handler is registered at module import time, which should resolve the "Invalid handler specified" error.

### Installation:
1. Copy the updated `custom_components/cutremure_infp/` folder to your Home Assistant config
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
4. Search for "Cutremure INFP Romania"

**This is the most direct fix yet - explicit handler registration is the recommended pattern for modern Home Assistant integrations.**
